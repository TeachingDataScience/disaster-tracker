Reliefweb Disaster App
======================

Relief Web is an organization that tracks international disaster preparedness and response. This application combines Relief Web's new [REST API](http://labs.reliefweb.int/) with a custom-built [Twitter timeline-processing script](https://github.com/developmentseed/twitter-server) to give authoritative, real-time updates on an occuring disaster.

This application's goal is to give an example of what developers can build with the Relief Web API, as well as create a re-usable disaster-specific app that can be rolled out quickly to track a natural disaster.
